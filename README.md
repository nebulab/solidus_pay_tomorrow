<!-- Explain what your extension does. -->

## Installation

Add solidus_pay_tomorrow to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'solidus_pay_tomorrow'
```

Bundle your dependencies and run the installation generator:

```shell
bin/rails generate solidus_pay_tomorrow:install
```

## Usage

<!-- Explain how to use your extension once it's been installed. -->

## Development

### Env variables
These are necessary to run the extension
```
PAY_TOMORROW_USERNAME - From payTomorrow dashboard
PAY_TOMORROW_PASSWORD - From payTomorrow dashboard
PAY_TOMORROW_SIGNATURE - From payTomorrow dashboard
PAY_TOMORROW_REDIRECT_BASE_URL - In dev mode, this could be an ngrok URL. Eg - https://80a5-125-63-97-62.in.ngrok.io
SOLIDUS_FRONTEND=solidus_frontend
SOLIDUS_BRANCH=v3.2
SKIP_SOLIDUS_BOLT=true
```

### Testing the extension

First bundle your dependencies, then run `bin/rake`. `bin/rake` will default to building the dummy
app if it does not exist, then it will run specs. The dummy app can be regenerated by using
`bin/rake extension:test_app`.

```shell
bin/rake
```

To run [Rubocop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop) static code analysis run

```shell
bundle exec rubocop
```

When testing your application's integration with this extension you may use its factories.
Simply add this require statement to your `spec/spec_helper.rb`:

```ruby
require 'solidus_pay_tomorrow/testing_support/factories'
```

Or, if you are using `FactoryBot.definition_file_paths`, you can load Solidus core
factories along with this extension's factories using this statement:

```ruby
SolidusDevSupport::TestingSupport::Factories.load_for(SolidusPayTomorrow::Engine)
```

### Running the sandbox

To run this extension in a sandboxed Solidus application, you can run `bin/sandbox`. The path for
the sandbox app is `./sandbox` and `bin/rails` will forward any Rails commands to
`sandbox/bin/rails`.

Here's an example:

```
$ bin/rails server
=> Booting Puma
=> Rails 6.0.2.1 application starting in development
* Listening on tcp://127.0.0.1:3000
Use Ctrl-C to stop
```

### Updating the changelog

Before and after releases the changelog should be updated to reflect the up-to-date status of
the project:

```shell
bin/rake changelog
git add CHANGELOG.md
git commit -m "Update the changelog"
```

### Releasing new versions
